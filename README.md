I hate my life

Okay, but how the fuck i use this?

Simple af, check it out:
```
python3 hash_useless_tool.py --someshit [Choice the fucking one-way hash] -d /home/../../ [The directory that will be worked by the Hash] -r /home/.. [The directory that the report will be saved] -v [Optional. This is the verbose mode. If you don't write this little piece of shit, the silent mode will "activate", and you basically will not see the fucking process.]
```
`And i still hating my fucking life.`
`a`
